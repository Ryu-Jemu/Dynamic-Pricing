# Production Configuration Override
# ================================================================
# This file overrides default.yaml values for production training.
# Usage: merge production.yaml over default.yaml before training.
#
# [CR-3] default.yaml is reduced for development (100K steps, 1 seed).
# Production requires full training budget for convergence.
